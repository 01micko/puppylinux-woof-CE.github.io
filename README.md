### A repo for the puppylinux.com site

This repository holds the files for the puppylinux.com web site.

We have decided to use the [markdown] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) language for the text portion of the files in order to make it simple for enyone to contribute content.

Contributions on web design are also welcome, as long as they do not complicate content contribution, and
as long as the contributor agrees to license their changes 	as CC0 (Public Domain).
