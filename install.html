## Puppy Linux Installation and Usage

The fact is that you do not need to install Puppy Linux at all! You can 
simply [download](index.html#download) and burn it to an optical disc
(CD, DVD, CD&plusmn;RW, DVD&plusmn;RW) or _dd_ it to an USB drive and
boot it _live_. When you are finished you can decide to save the session
or not! Not saving the session does not leave a trace of the operating 
system as Puppy runs entirely in RAM and as soon as the computer is
powered off the RAM is flushed. This is ideal from a security perspective
for internet banking or other sensitive financial transactions performed
over the internet.

Saving the session this can be achieved in a number of ways:
 
 1. You can save the session to a harddrive or an USB drive in a vfat,
    ntfs or linux<sup><a href="#part">[1]</a></sup> partition. This 
    will save all your settings to what is known as a _pupsave_
    <sup><a href="#save">[2]</a></sup> file or folder. When you boot off the 
    same media next time the _pupsave_ will be found and all your files
    and settings will be as you left them. 
 
 2. If you booted off of optical media you can save the session and all
    settings back to that same optical disc.
    
### So you want to _install_ Puppy

Naturally you can actually install Puppy if you wish. Once you boot Puppy
and are happy with what you see it is time to open the _Puppy Installer_
from _Setup_ in the main menu. There are 3 main types of install; _frugal_,
_USB_ and traditional _full_ install.

#### 1. Frugal install (**Recommended**)
    
>**This type of install copies the main puppy files from the boot
media (either optical or USB) to your harddrive**. Firstly, you are
presented with some information about your system and what partitions
you have available. If you don't have a suitable partition then you can
use the included graphical partition manager _GParted_ to shrink and 
move partitions as necessary to created a partition for your installation.
Once this is done you are prompted for the location of your boot
media files (either an iso image, optical media or just the files
themselves) and once confirmed these are copied to a folder in your
chosen partition. A _bootloader_ is then installed and once finished
you can reboot into your new system.

>This will be a pristine system that requires you to save your session at 
shut down if you want to keep your settings. Once saving the session
is complete, a _pupsave_ file or folder is created. On you next boot
your files and settings will be exactly as you left them at last shutdown.
    
#### 2. USB Install (**Recommended**)
  
>**This type of install copies the main puppy files from the boot
media (either optical or USB) to your chosen USB drive**. Firstly, you 
should insert the USB drive that you want to use for installation. Again 
using the graphical partition manager _GParted_ you need to make sure
that there is a suitable partition on the USB drive. This can be formatted
to _fat32_ Windows™ style filesystem (good for portability if you want 
to use the drive as storage to be used between Linux and Windows™) or 
one of the supported Linux filesystems. (**Note**: not all Puppies
support the f2fs filesystem. The installer is intelligent enough
to know this.) Again, you are prompted for the location of your boot
media files (either an iso image, optical media or just the files
themselves) and once confirmed these are copied to a folder in your
chosen USB drive. A _bootloader_ is then installed and once finished
you can reboot into your new system. This can be booted on any computer
you like!

>Again, this will be a pristine system that requires you to save your 
session at shut down if you want to keep your settings. Once saving the 
session is complete, a _pupsave_ file or folder is created. On you next 
boot your files and settings will be exactly as you left them at last 
shutdown.
    
#### 3. Full Install
  
>**This is a traditonal Linux install to its own dedicated partition.**
If you don't have a suitable partition then you can
use the included graphical partition manager _GParted_ to shrink and 
move partitions as necessary to created a partition for your installation.
**You must use a Linux filesystem**.
Once this is done you are prompted for the location of your boot
media files (either an iso image, optical media or just the files
themselves) and once confirmed these are _expanded_ in your
chosen partition. A _bootloader_ is then installed and once finished
you can reboot into your new system.

>Once booted this will act like any other Linux installation.

<br/>

While we recommend _frugal_ or _USB_ installations the choice is entirely
yours.

<a id="part">[1]</a> Some common linux partition filesystems that Puppy 
supports are ext2, ext3, ext4, f2fs. Windows™ filesystems supported are
fat16, fat32 and ntfs.

<a id="save">[2]</a> A _pupsave_ **file** is a file that contains a linux
filesystem. It can be stored on any supported partition. It is a fixed size
and can be as small as 32MB and as large as 4GB (on fat32) and even larger
on other filesystems.

A _pupsave_ **folder** can only be created on a _linux_ filesystem. This 
allows you to store as much as your partition can hold.
