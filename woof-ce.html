## Puppy Linux Woof-CE

Woof-CE is a collection of build scripts that will automatically
build a Puppy Linux distribution from scratch. 
It also has puppy-specific configuration files, applications and themes
that provide the charachteristic puppy look and feel regardless of the
packages used to build a puppy. 

Woof is versatile and very
flexible. To build a Puppy, it can use packages from a parent
distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Slackware) or it can also use self-compiled
puppy-specific packages (pets). It supports multiple architectures (x86, x86_64 and arm).

Puppy Linux Woof-CE is **the** official build system for making a Puppy
Linux distribution, going forward. 
_If it is not built from Woof-CE, it is not a Puppy_.


### The name

_Woof-CE_ stands for _Woof Community Edition_. The name _Woof_ itself
is chosen because ... well, what's more appropriate then a sound of 
a dog's bark to indicate a presence of a new distribution, if the
distribution's name itself is _Puppy_? â˜º


### Building Puppy from Woof-CE.

1. Make a local clone of Woof-CE repository, from 
   [https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE].
2. TBA.



### Contributing

Woof-CE is kept on [github.com](https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE).
Everybody is welcome to download and use it to build a Puppy, or even
fork it.

But if you want your modifications to be included and used for future
puppies, they must be merged back to the original Woof-CE repository.
To merge that, you need to send a patch or better yet a pull request
to the Woof-CE repository.

The [Woof-CE stewards](team.html#stewards) will then consider your 
request and merge them if they feel that your changes are beneficial 
for everyone. If your patch is not accepted, don't feel bad. Often
it is just a little changes you need to apply before resubmitting
the request again. Even if the rejection is final, be glad to know
the puppy you build with your changes is now unique - no other puppy
will work like it because it's the only one that has your unique changes.
