## Puppy Linux Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQ)


### Official and latest versions

 - **Q**: What is an official Puppy Linux distribution? <br>
   **A**: It must meet two conditions. 1) It must be built using
   Woof-CE. 2) It must be endorsed as "official" by the Puppy Master.

 - **Q**: What is the latest version of official Puppy Linux? <br>
   **A**: Check the [homepage](index.html) of this site. If need be,
   press Ctrl-F5 to force it to refresh the page.
   
 - **Q**: Is Puppy really a multiple distributions that live under 
   the same name? What makes them Puppy? <br>
   **A**: Yes. All of them are built using Woof-CE.
   
 - **Q**: This is silly, a _family_ of distributions? How do I know
   which Puppy I should use? <br>
   **A**: Please feel free to try whichever flavours that entices you
   first. If you don't like it, you can try another one. If you still
   don't like it, try one of the CE versions, or try the puplets.

 - **Q**: Puppy Linux earlier than 6.x was not build from Woof-CE (Woof-CE 
   didn't exist then). So are they really official Puppies? <br>
   **A**: Yes, obviously. All puppies from 0.x to 5.x are Puppies if they
   are either made by Barry, endorsed by Barry, or built from Woof.
   But going forward, only those created from Woof-CE is considerd
   as Puppy.
 
 - **Q**: Is my remaster is considered a Puppy? It is not built from 
   Woof-CE<br>
   **A**: Yes. As long as the base you use for remaster is a Puppy, then
   the remaster itself is considered as a Puppy. It is not an official
   Puppy, though.



### Remasters

 - **Q**: What is a remaster? <br>
   **A**: A remaster is Puppy Linux ISO that is built from an original
   ISO with changes applied, usually to add/remove some applications 
   and preset some configurations. More extensive remasters exists that
   also changes/improves upon the base behaviour of Puppy itself.
   
 - **Q**: Am I allowed to distribute my remasters? <br>
   **A**: Not only allowed, you are encouraged to!



### About other Puppy Linux-like distributions

 - **Q**: Is DebianDog considered as Puppy Linux? <br>
   **A**: No. The maintainer itself has said so. Further more it is not
   built from Woof-CE. But it seeks to emulate most if not all of Puppy
   Linux features and behaviours; that if you are familiar with Puppy
   you would be right at home about it.
   
 - **Q**: If DebianDog is not Puppy, why do you support them, or 
   even mention them here? <br>
   **A**: Anything which is not against us, is with us. We are one
   big happy family â˜º
 
 - **Q**: Is Quirky Linux considered as Puppy Linux? It is also made by 
   Barry.<br>
   **A**: No, Barry himself has stated multiple times that 
   [Quirky is not Puppy](http://barryk.org/news/?viewDetailed=00266)
 
 - **Q**: Is Fatdog64 considered as Puppy Linux? <br>
   **A**: No. It is a fork of Puppy Linux, which happened at Puppy 4.0.
 
 
 
### About Puppy Linux Team
  
 - **Q**: First you say Puppy Linux Team has no organisation. Then you
   talk about stewards. Isn't that an oxymoron? <br>
   **A**: First, oxymoron is about a word, not an idea. Secondly,
   "lack of organisation" and "presence of stewards" is not as 
   contradicting as you think.
   
 - **Q**: Seriously, who is in charge of Puppy Linux? Aren't the Woof-CE 
   stewards the people behind it? <br>
   **A**: Consider these Woof-CE stewards as gatekeepers. They filter
   what goes into Woof-CE, and thus Puppy Linux. They don't, as a rule,
   make modifications to Woof-CE themselves; they wait for the Puppy 
   Linux Team (that's you!) to submit patches and pull requests and
   _only then_ they act on it.
   
   There are direct committers to Woof-CE but usually these people don't
   play the role of gatekeepers / stewards. They are simply people that
   the stewards have trusted enough to give them push access.
