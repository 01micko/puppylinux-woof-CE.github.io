## Puppy Linux Family Tree

If you come to this after reading [Puppy Linux history](history.html),
you are forgiven if you think that Puppy Linux as a nice, linear
progression from Series 0.x to Series 6.x. 

The reality is nothing like that, though ... 
Below is a simplified diagram that shows Puppy Linux distributions, 
spread over time.

As you can see, everything is relatively calm and ordered until 
Woof was introduced at Series 4.x. Until that time, Puppy Linux is
a traditional, single distribution like others. 

By the completion of 4.x series at version 4.3, however, there was
an explosion and Puppy Linux become a family of distributions with 
multiple official Puppies at the same time.

At the end of Puppy Linux 4.3, Puppy Linux was split into multiple
distributions (but still sharing the same principles, built using 
the same set of tools, and provide consistent features between all of
them).

 - Lucid Puppy - a Puppy based on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx. The current version 
   is Tahrpup, which is based on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr.
   
 - Slacko Puppy - a Slackaware-based Puppy. Originally it was built from
   Slackware 13.37; current version is uses Slackawre 14.1 as its base.
   
 - Racy and Wary - the traditional 
   self-compiled T2-based Puppy.
 
 - Quirky - an experimental release of Puppy, which later was forked
   and made into its own distribution, independent of Puppy Linux.




### Puplets

In addition the "official" puppies, there are also a multitude of
unofficial Puppies, built by Puppy enthusiasts. Usually (but not always)
made as a remaster, they fill the niche of almost every need. They
are usually called as _"puplets"_.

They are as much a member of Puppy Linux family as the official releases
themselves.

Here are some of the more notable puplets, in no particular order:

  * Macpup - a puplet by _runtt21_ which takes its design inspiration
    from Mac OSX™. Its main feature is that it uses the Enlightnment
    Desktop Environment.
    
  * Saluki - this one is by _jemima_ and its standout feature is the
    XFCE desktop environment and "under the hood" innovations such as
    an 'a-drive' sfs which gets loaded at first boot. _jemima_ is also
    famous for the _puppeee_ and _fluppy_ puplets - hardware specific puplets
    targeting the Asus EEE pc.
    
  * LightHouse Pup - a comprehensive puplet designed to be extended with
    specialised sfs packages for KDE, XFCE and other large programs. First
    developed by _tazoc_ and later taken up by _Dry Falls_.
    
  * NOP (No Office Pup) - produced by _gray_ featuring the removal of office
    apps and the addition of the XFCE Desktop Environment.
    
  * 214X - an extension to the famous Puppy 2.1.4 with upgraded _glibc_,
    kernel and other updated software. Produced by _ttuuxxx_ who has many
    more puplets!
    
  * Dpup Exprimo - a woof built puppy from the ground up by _pemasu_. This 
    is a very well liked puplet even to this day. It has binary compatibility
    with Debian Squeeze. This could well have been an "official" Puppy!
    
This is by no means an exhaustive list. If running or even making a puplet
is in your interest you should browse 
[_ally's_ collection](https://archive.org/details/puppylinux) or vist the
[puplets area](http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/index.php?f=35) of the 
Puppy Linux Discussion Forum.

### Other notable offshots

These are not considered Puppy Linux per se, but they own their
existence to Puppy Linux in one way or another.

 * Quirky → Originally created by Barry Kauler as a test-bed for crazy 
   and quirky ideas (hence its name) before integrating them to the main 
   Puppy Linux.
   
   When Barry stepped down, he handed over Puppy Linux to the community
   but kept Quirky to himself; and Quirky became a separate distribution
   separate from Puppy Linux. Although it feels very Puppy Linux-like
   due to its heritage, Barry himself said many times that Quirky 
   is **not** Puppy and don't expect it to behave and work like Puppy.
   
   Even as a separate distribution, it still retains its purpose as a
   test-bed for various ideas. Maintained by Barry Kauler himself.
     
 * [Woof-CE](woof-ce.html) → Woof-CE is not a Puppy Linux distribution.
   It is actually a build system used to build various Puppy Linux
   distributions. It is listed here because it is also an offshot of
   Barry's original Puppy Linux development.
 
 * Debian Dog → Adaptation of Debian Live-CD to make it behave like
   Puppy Linux. Originally started by forum member _sickgut_ as a proof
   that any normal distribution can be molded to behave like Puppy Linux,
   it was later renamed to Debian Dog by its current maintainer
   (Toni aka _saintless_).
 
 * Fatdog → Forked from Puppy Linux 4.0. Fatdog is notable in being
   the first Puppy-Linux like distribution that went fully 64-bit in
   year 2009. Maintained by _kirk_ and _jamesbond_.
 
 * Simplicity Linux →  A derivative of the LXPup puplet originally
   created by _Jejy69_ and carried on by _peebee_. Maintained by
   David Purse.
 
 * Puppy Studio →  A commercial Puppy Linux derivative targeted at
   artists, mainly musicians. Maintained by _l0wtech_.
