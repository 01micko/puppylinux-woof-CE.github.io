## Puppy Linux Family Tree

If you come to this after reading [Puppy Linux history](history.html),
you are forgiven if you think that Puppy Linux as a nice, linear
progression from Series 0.x to Series 6.x. The reality is nothing
like that, though ... Below is a simplified diagram that shows 
Puppy Linux distributions, spread over time.

Some sort of graphics would be nice here ...

 - Puppy Linux 2.x - CE
 - Puppy Linux 3.x
 - Puppy Linux 4.x - first Woof branch
 - Puppy Linux 4.x - CE
 - Puppy Linux 5.x - the reign of Lupu
 - Puppy Linux 6.x - the reign of Slacko

### Notable puplets

Without any particular order:

|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------------|---------------|
|Macpup  | ?            | Remaster     | runtt21    |                    |               |
|Puppeee |              | Remaster     | None       |                    |               |

[List of all puplets](puplets-list-full.html)

**Notes**

1. Macpup → MacOSX-like user interface.

2. Puppeee → targeted specifically at various EeePC. The original maintainer 
   (jemimah) spent $$$ of her own money to collect various editions of 
   EeePC for testing her distribtion.
   
3. Saluki → from the same author of Puppeee, this is a modular Puppy and 
   was said to be the most good-looking Puppy, ever.



### Other notable offshots

These are not considered Puppy Linux perse, but they own their
existence to Puppy Linux in one way or another.

 * Quirky → Originally created by Barry Kauler as a test-bed for crazy 
   and quirky ideas before integrating them to the main Puppy Linux.
   
   It has since become its own distribution when Barry decided to step
   down and hand over the Puppy Linux future to the community.
   Maintained by Barry Kauler himself.
 
 * Debian Dog → Adaptation of Debian Live-CD to make it behave like
   Puppy Linux. Originally started by forum member _sickgut_ as a proof
   that any normal distribution can be molded to behave like Puppy Linux,
   it was later renamed to Debian Dog by its current maintainer
   (Toni aka _saintless_).
 
 * Fatdog → Forked from Puppy Linux 4.0. Fatdog is notable in being
   the first Puppy-Linux like distribution that went fully 64-bit in
   year 2009. Maintained by _kirk_ and _jamesbond_.
 
 * Simplicity Linux →  ????
 
 * Puppy Studio →  A commercial Puppy Linux derivative targeted at
   artists, mainly musicians. Maintained by _l0wtech_.
