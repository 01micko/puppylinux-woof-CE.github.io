## Puppy Linux History

Puppy Linux was originally created by [Barry Kauler](http://barryk.org/news) 
in 2003, as a smaller, leaner version of Vector Linux. 

From the beginning, the idea was to make a small, lean, yet 
complete edition of Linux distribution that was useful from the get-go: 
the downloaded ISO contains all the standard applications to handle usual
computing needs: word processor, spreadsheet, and web browser.
 
Another central idea that the OS would work off as a Live-CD, but
with support for _"persistence"_ - that is, keep data between reboot 
sessions. This way, the Live-CD can be used as if it is a fully installed
operating system. However, if user data is corrupted in anyway, 
in a flick of a switch the persistence can be turned off and Puppy 
would boot in its pristine, Live-CD state.
 
Size has always been a major consideration. Linux of these early days
did not have good hardware support, thus Linux machines tend to be older
and more obsolete computers with older CPUs and little RAM and storage.
Also, broadband internet was not popular yet back then - many users
were still on dial-up which limited the download speed to 38Kbps.
So conscious decision were made to choose software components which
provides the maximum functionality at a given size; e.g. the choice of
ROX Filer as the file manager (which has stuck until today).



### The very beginning - Series 0.x
 
The first few releases were marked as 0.x versions, the last being
version 0.9. These early releases didn't use unionfs, thus the
persistence support was minimal; and only a few directories can keep
user changes.

Packages in Puppy Linux of this version was taken from Vector Linux
as well as self-compiled.



### Series 1.x

Series 1.x included major changes; the most obvious one being its use
of unionfs. This means entire Linux filesystem root can now be 
persisted.

Another major change was the UI make-up, this version started to use 
GTK as its widget toolkit, replacing the original Xlib toolkit used
in version 0.x.

This version also introduced the ever popular "Remaster" option which
enables anyone to make customise their Puppy installation by adding /
removing packages and configuring their system; and then make a new
Puppy ISO which contains all these changes.



### Series 2.x

Series 2.x was a breakthrough in many ways.

It saw the update of GTK from GTK1 to GTK2, as well as support
for more persistence modes - not only Puppy was able to keep its session
in a harddisk, but also in USB flash drive, and even in it is own CD
(if the CD is a CD-R or CD-RW). 

With the Linux kernel supporting better hardware support around the 
time of 2.x release, Puppy was able to run on newer machines with
complete support for networking, wifi, USB, sound, and video - making
it the idea work-and-entertainment Linux distro.

It also introduced the first version of Puppy whose packages
were built independently using T2 build system.

It also introduced *"Puppy Unleashed"* build system, a tool for
advanced users to build their own customised Puppy from scratch.

Series 2.x was very popular, and it was longest-running series ever.
The last version was 2.14, and that branch was kept alive and upgraded
by dedicated enthusiast forum members even until today.



### Series 3.x

Series 3.x is the a short-lived branch. It was the first experiment
of basing off Puppy from other distributions - in this case, Slackware.

While some people stood by this series, many felt that in many ways
this was too experimental. The usage of a big-distro packages (Slackware) 
made it consume more memory than earlier Puppies, as well as made it
slower.

The latest version of this series was 3.0.1.



### Series 4.x

In this series, Puppy went back to its roots and used its own 
self-compiled packages from T2, which made it lean and fast again.

In addition, this version introduced the "Woof" build system.
The difference between "Woof" and "Puppy Unleashed" is that while
"Puppy Unleashed" used pre-packaged Puppy packages, the "Woof" build
system is able to build a Puppy directly from completely foreign distro packages.

While the official Puppy distributions in the 4.x series were all based
on T2 builds, Woof support's for other distro resulted in an explosion
of community-initiated puplets based on them:
 
 * Upup - a Woof-built puplet based on Ubuntu
 * Dpup - a Woof-built puplet based on Debian
 * Spup - a Woof-built puplet based on Slackware 
 * Apup - a Woof-built puplet based on Arch Linux

This version also introduced the release of _"Quirky"_ - which was
meant as a special release of Puppy Linux that contains experimental
features. The idea being, once those features matured (and considered
useful by the community), they would be integrated back to the 
mainstream release.

It is also in this version Barry indicated that he would step down
from his role as Puppy benevolent dictator and would focus instead
on maintaining "Woof"; hoping that the community would take the baton
and do the Puppy-building themselves.

The latest version of 4.x was 4.3.1.

Just like Series 2.x, there where community members who hold 
steadfastly to this series and keep maintaining it beyond long after
Barry was finished with it - it is still maintained until today.



### Version 5.x

This version saw the first official Puppy Linux distro ("official" as in
being endorsed by Barry) which was not released by Barry.

The official Puppy Linux of Series 5.x grew up from _Upup_ - a Woof-built
Puppy from Ubuntu packages. It was called Luci during its development and
proclaimed as _Lupu_ (Lucid Puppy) upon release. It was developed and 
maintained by Larry Short (aka _playdayz_). 

The series proved to be very popular. It was the first good-looking
Puppy, it was the first Puppy which had great focus on user-friendliness
("Linux distro for Windows refugee" was first coined during Series 5.x),
it was the first non-CE release that was built from community feedback,
and it had the backings of immense number of Ubuntu packages, 
many of them directly installable and usable from its package manager.

Version 5.x also saw the release of Puppy Racy from Barry, built from
T2 packages, for those who considered that Lupu was too heavy for 
their machines. 

Lupu was and is very popular and different forks are still maintained
by different people until today, after Larry stepped down and ended
his support. It is still popular even after Ubuntu itself discontinued
support for Ubuntu Lucid Lynx, the distro on which Lupu was based.



### Series 6.x

Series 6.x Puppy is a fully community effort.

Barry stepped down from Puppy **and** Woof effort, leaving everything
to the stewards of the community to continue development of everything
Puppy-related.

The Woof build system is renamed as "Woof-CE" (Woof Community Edition).
The first official release from Woof-CE is Puppy Linux Slacko 
(Slacko Puppy) 6.3.0.



## Community Editions

Before the launch of "Woof", Barry was fully in charge of releasing
Puppy Linux. Once a while however, Barry encouraged the community to take 
the latest release, enhance it in anyway they see fit, and release it
as a _"Community Edition" (CE)_ Puppy with his endorsement.

A CE release is usually coordinated by a community-appointed
"project manager", and supported by a few "core" developers who
did the actual customisations - code, packages, artwork, etc, based
on feedback on the community. CE project usually runs between one to
three months with many releases in between to test for community feedback
before the final release.

CE releases usually provide richer experiences than standard
releases; they are usually better looking and more user-friendly due
to many contributions and integration of feedback from community during 
their development.

Every series had its CE release. Series 1.x has 1.09-CE; Series 2 has 
2.15CE, series 4.x has 4.2 and 4.2.1CE. The series 5.x Puppy is 
virtually a CE too by every definition, except by name.

The CE tradition, however, ended after the release of "Woof".

After the release of Woof it was trivial for advanced users to release 
custom versions of Puppy; this resulted in many puplets and 
competition for community attention between them. 

It diluted the concentrated effort required to make a successful CE. 
4.2CE took a very long time (compared to earlier CEs) due to this; 
it competed for resources with Upup would become the official 
Series 5.x Puppy, which is also a CE by every definition except by name.
