## Puppy Linux Forums

Puppy Linux has a wonderful community that is very helpful. Through the 
generous contribution of John Murga we have our own dedicated forum that is
_the_ place to get help, report bugs or just generally hang out with like
minded Puppy enthusiasts.

There are also two alternative forums available, the first generously
supplied by Raffy and the second at Linux Questions.
